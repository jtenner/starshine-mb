# Agent Tasks

## Blockers
- None currently.

## Goal
Reach v0.1.0 “production-ready for MoonBit users” by end of March 2026: full native CLI, spec-test passing validator+optimizer, clean public API, and maintainable codebase.

## Scope
- This file tracks open work prioritized for v0.1 release.
- Recently completed items may remain checked until the next audit pass.

## Metadata
- Last updated: `2026-02-25`
- Last audit run: `2026-02-25`

### Release quality gates
- [ ] Make `module_to_wast` output reliably parser-consumable in roundtrip tests.
- [ ] Reach `>=75%` line coverage on hot paths (decoder, IR lift, top passes).

## Priority 1 (Release polish)
- [ ] Publish first release + MoonBit registry package (`moon publish` + GitHub Release binaries).

## Deferred After v0.1
- [ ] `Poppify`
- [ ] `Outlining` as a standalone pass (beyond current inlining partial-splitting behavior)
- [ ] Broad Binaryen pass parity backlog (medium/low priority pass list)
- [ ] Large refactors: file splits (`typecheck`/`env`/`transformer`/`optimize`/`remove_unused`/`parser`) and `decode_instruction` helper decomposition
- [ ] Long-horizon platform/features: Component Model/WIT, streaming decoder API, custom sections/source maps, plugin system
- [ ] Replace conservative legacy-exception lowering with semantic-preserving lowering to `try_table`/`throw_ref` (current path is static-validation oriented).
- [ ] Tune/replace `gen_valid_module` candidate generation for harness throughput so fewer candidates are discarded before the 100k valid target.
- [ ] Add `re_reloop` end-to-end coverage for internal loop-target `br_table` cases carrying branch values (non-empty `values`) to lock in typed value-flow behavior.
