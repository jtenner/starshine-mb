# `code-pushing`

## Role

`code-pushing` is an upstream Binaryen function pass and an active explicit HOT pass in Starshine.

Its purpose is to move single-assignment local writes later when doing so preserves behavior and makes the write execute closer to the control-flow path that consumes it.

The current source-backed Binaryen mental model is:

- analyze locals for single-first-assignment (SFA) behavior;
- scan structured block root segments with `Pusher`;
- admit only pushable `local.set` roots whose value effects are safe;
- push toward `if`, `switch`, conditional `br`, or dropped push-point wrappers;
- sink into the one `if` arm that reads the local, with an important unreachable-arm post-use allowance;
- rely on later optimizer cycles for deeper recursive opportunities.

The current Starshine implementation is an accepted direct-pass subset under Starshine's pass-wide completion criteria:

- safe movable-value `local.set` sinking into the single `if` arm that contains all reads of that local;
- guarded movement of selected `global.get` and local-copy setup shapes across safe intervening roots;
- one Starshine-local typed/dead-block flattening helper near unreachable context.

Acceptance does **not** require raw wasm/text or transform-for-transform parity. The direct pass is complete when it preserves Binaryen semantics, produces valid wasm, and stays at least 50% as fast as Binaryen on comparable pass-local measurements.

## 2026-04-26 correction

This folder previously contained a 2026-04-25 correction that removed `Pusher`, segment selection, and local profitability-style movement from the upstream teaching. That correction was itself stale/wrong after a fresh official-source recheck.

The preferred source manifest is now:

- [`../../../raw/binaryen/2026-06-20-code-pushing-version-130-source-lit-refresh.md`](../../../raw/binaryen/2026-06-20-code-pushing-version-130-source-lit-refresh.md)
- [`../../../raw/research/0807-2026-06-20-code-pushing-version-130-source-lit-refresh.md`](../../../raw/research/0807-2026-06-20-code-pushing-version-130-source-lit-refresh.md)
- [`../../../raw/binaryen/2026-05-05-code-pushing-current-main-recheck.md`](../../../raw/binaryen/2026-05-05-code-pushing-current-main-recheck.md)
- [`../../../raw/research/0454-2026-05-05-code-pushing-current-main-recheck.md`](../../../raw/research/0454-2026-05-05-code-pushing-current-main-recheck.md)

The 2026-06-20 `version_130` refresh is the current local-oracle source bridge. It keeps the same owner and scheduler surfaces, adds `code-pushing-atomics.wast` as an audit-relevant lit family, and records the `version_130` effect-ordering drift from `invalidates(...)` to `effects.orderedBefore(cumulativeEffects)`. Keep the useful part of the 2026-04-25 warning: do not teach arbitrary two-live-arm duplication as the baseline. But restore the correct upstream owner concepts: `LocalAnalyzer`, `Pusher`, segment windows, `isPushable`, `isPushPoint`, and `optimizeSegment`.

## Why it matters

- Binaryen schedules `code-pushing` in the canonical no-DWARF function pipeline between `precompute` and the tuple/local-cleanup neighborhood.
- The saved generated-artifact `-O4z` audit recorded it as top-level skipped slot `20` before Starshine grew the current direct subset.
- Starshine's `tuple-optimization` exact-slot story still depends on this pass and the now-active `simplify-locals-nostructure` neighbor being represented honestly in the scheduler and preset replay.
- The pass is easy to over-broaden. Correctness depends on SFA local proofs, effect ordering/invalidation, trap policy, GC/reference behavior, atomics, EH, and post-if read rules.

## Inputs and outputs

### Upstream Binaryen input shape

- Function-local structured expression trees.
- Block root lists containing `local.set` temporaries and later push points.
- Local get/set information and effect properties.
- Optimization options that affect implicit traps and traps-never-happen behavior.

### Upstream Binaryen output shape

- Some pushable `local.set` roots move later within the same block segment.
- Some sets move into the only `if` arm that reads their local.
- Moved sets keep order and should execute on the same or fewer paths as allowed by the proof.
- Unproven shapes stay unchanged.

### Current Starshine input shape

- HOT functions lifted into `HotFunc`.
- Region roots containing local writes, structured `if`s, blocks, and unreachable roots.

### Current Starshine output shape

- Narrow single-consuming-arm local-set sinks become `nop` at the original root plus a cloned `local.set` inside the target arm.
- Some typed/dead block roots near unreachable context are spliced into the parent region.
- Unmatched shapes stay unchanged.

## Invariants and correctness constraints

- Do not move non-SFA locals without a stronger local-use proof.
- Do not move values across effects that can invalidate or must be ordered after the delayed computation.
- Do not change trap timing unless the active trap policy explicitly permits that behavior.
- Do not strand post-if uses unless the non-consuming arm cannot fall through or another proof preserves the value.
- Do not treat two-live-arm duplication as a default `code-pushing` behavior.
- Preserve order among multiple pushed sets.
- Preserve function validity after structural mutation.
- Keep Starshine-local dead-block flattening documented separately from upstream Binaryen behavior.
- Do not claim public preset parity until the exact scheduler neighborhood is implemented and validated.
- Do not treat raw wasm/text drift as a blocker when normalized/canonical semantic comparison is green.

## Notable edge cases

- One `if` arm consumes the local and the other does not.
- Post-if reads where the non-consuming arm is unreachable.
- `switch` and conditional `br` push points.
- Trap-capable expressions under default, ignore-implicit-traps, and TNH options.
- GC/reference operations such as `ref.func`, casts, null checks, and the `version_130` atomics/GC ordering family.
- EH control where movement can change exceptional observability.
- Starshine dead-block flattening, which is local cleanup rather than upstream `CodePushing.cpp` behavior.

## Validation

The older direct `--pass code-pushing` lane was accepted under the previous v0.1.0 direct-pass standard, but `[O4Z-AUDIT-CP]` has reopened broader behavior-parity audit work. The 2026-05-09 evidence remains useful for the then-current subset:

- `moon info`, `moon fmt`, and `moon test` green;
- `.tmp/pass-fuzz-code-pushing` compared 6759/10000 cases with 6759 normalized matches, 0 semantic mismatches, and 20 Binaryen empty-recursion-group parser/canonicalization command failures;
- direct debug-artifact replay at `/tmp/starshine-self-optimize-compare-starshine-debug-wasi-1687067` reported `Normalized WAT equal: yes` and `Canonical function compare equal: yes`;
- pass-local timing was about 1658ms for Starshine versus about 1311ms for Binaryen, which is above the required 50%-of-Binaryen speed floor.

Raw canonical wasm/text still differs, but that is accepted representation drift rather than active `code-pushing` work.

For docs maintenance:

- prefer the 2026-06-20 `version_130` source/lit refresh over the older 2026-05-05, 2026-04-26, and 2026-04-25 corrections;
- search for stale “no `Pusher`,” “no segment selection,” or “no local profitability” wording in this folder;
- keep the no-two-live-arm-duplication warning, but do not erase Binaryen's real `Pusher` model.

For current `[O4Z-AUDIT-CP]` widening:

1. add focused tests in `src/passes/code_pushing_test.mbt` before widening behavior;
2. build an analyzer/segment-discovery slice before broad mutation;
3. validate direct pass execution through registry and command surfaces;
4. compare reduced WAT against Binaryen `wasm-opt --code-pushing` for each widened family;
5. then run pass-fuzz / artifact comparisons under the standard pass signoff criteria;
6. only after ordered-neighborhood proof revisit public preset placement.
