# `code-pushing`

## Role

`code-pushing` is an upstream Binaryen function pass and an active explicit HOT pass in Starshine.

Its purpose is to move single-assignment local writes later when doing so preserves behavior and makes the write execute closer to the control-flow path that consumes it.

The current source-backed Binaryen mental model is:

- analyze locals for single-first-assignment (SFA) behavior;
- scan structured block root segments with `Pusher`;
- admit only pushable `local.set` roots whose value effects are safe;
- push toward `if`, `switch`, conditional `br`, or dropped push-point wrappers;
- sink into the one `if` arm that reads the local, with an important unreachable-arm post-use allowance;
- rely on later optimizer cycles for deeper recursive opportunities.

The current Starshine implementation is a conservative subset:

- const-like `local.set` sinking into the single `if` arm that contains all reads of that local;
- plus one Starshine-local typed/dead-block flattening helper near unreachable context.

## 2026-04-26 correction

This folder previously contained a 2026-04-25 correction that removed `Pusher`, segment selection, and local profitability-style movement from the upstream teaching. That correction was itself stale/wrong after a fresh official-source recheck.

The preferred source manifest is now:

- [`../../../raw/binaryen/2026-04-26-code-pushing-current-main-port-readiness.md`](../../../raw/binaryen/2026-04-26-code-pushing-current-main-port-readiness.md)
- [`../../../raw/research/0413-2026-04-26-code-pushing-current-main-port-readiness.md`](../../../raw/research/0413-2026-04-26-code-pushing-current-main-port-readiness.md)

Keep the useful part of the 2026-04-25 warning: do not teach arbitrary two-live-arm duplication as the baseline. But restore the correct upstream owner concepts: `LocalAnalyzer`, `Pusher`, segment windows, `isPushable`, `isPushPoint`, and `optimizeSegment`.

## Why it matters

- Binaryen schedules `code-pushing` in the canonical no-DWARF function pipeline between `precompute` and the tuple/local-cleanup neighborhood.
- The saved generated-artifact `-O4z` audit recorded it as top-level skipped slot `20` before Starshine grew the current direct subset.
- Starshine's `tuple-optimization` exact-slot story still depends on this pass and the now-active `simplify-locals-nostructure` neighbor being represented honestly in the scheduler and preset replay.
- The pass is easy to over-broaden. Correctness depends on SFA local proofs, effect invalidation, trap policy, GC/reference behavior, EH, and post-if read rules.

## Inputs and outputs

### Upstream Binaryen input shape

- Function-local structured expression trees.
- Block root lists containing `local.set` temporaries and later push points.
- Local get/set information and effect properties.
- Optimization options that affect implicit traps and traps-never-happen behavior.

### Upstream Binaryen output shape

- Some pushable `local.set` roots move later within the same block segment.
- Some sets move into the only `if` arm that reads their local.
- Moved sets keep order and should execute on the same or fewer paths as allowed by the proof.
- Unproven shapes stay unchanged.

### Current Starshine input shape

- HOT functions lifted into `HotFunc`.
- Region roots containing local writes, structured `if`s, blocks, and unreachable roots.

### Current Starshine output shape

- Narrow single-consuming-arm local-set sinks become `nop` at the original root plus a cloned `local.set` inside the target arm.
- Some typed/dead block roots near unreachable context are spliced into the parent region.
- Unmatched shapes stay unchanged.

## Invariants and correctness constraints

- Do not move non-SFA locals without a stronger local-use proof.
- Do not move values across effects that can invalidate the delayed computation.
- Do not change trap timing unless the active trap policy explicitly permits that behavior.
- Do not strand post-if uses unless the non-consuming arm cannot fall through or another proof preserves the value.
- Do not treat two-live-arm duplication as a default `code-pushing` behavior.
- Preserve order among multiple pushed sets.
- Preserve function validity after structural mutation.
- Keep Starshine-local dead-block flattening documented separately from upstream Binaryen behavior.
- Do not claim public preset parity until the exact scheduler neighborhood is implemented and validated.

## Notable edge cases

- One `if` arm consumes the local and the other does not.
- Post-if reads where the non-consuming arm is unreachable.
- `switch` and conditional `br` push points.
- Trap-capable expressions under default, ignore-implicit-traps, and TNH options.
- GC/reference operations such as `ref.func`, casts, and null checks.
- EH control where movement can change exceptional observability.
- Starshine dead-block flattening, which is local cleanup rather than upstream `CodePushing.cpp` behavior.

## Validation

For docs maintenance:

- prefer the 2026-04-26 manifest over the 2026-04-25 correction;
- search for stale “no `Pusher`,” “no segment selection,” or “no local profitability” wording in this folder;
- keep the no-two-live-arm-duplication warning, but do not erase Binaryen's real `Pusher` model.

For future code work:

1. add focused tests in `src/passes/code_pushing_test.mbt` before widening behavior;
2. build an analyzer/segment-discovery slice before broad mutation;
3. validate direct pass execution through registry and command surfaces;
4. compare reduced WAT against Binaryen `wasm-opt --code-pushing` for each widened family;
5. then run pass-fuzz / artifact comparisons for the `CP` backlog slice;
6. only after that revisit preset placement.
