# Starshine DAE2 implementation

This page describes the implemented Binaryen 132 port, superseding the earlier
proposal to leave `dae2` unknown or to add only parameter forwarding.

The module pass owns a short-lived usage graph. Each function parameter and
whole result tuple has a location; HOT expression values have locations too.
Type-family locations connect referenced functions to indirect calls. Observable
uses seed the graph, and a queue visits each live location at most once.

Direct call arguments depend on the corresponding callee parameter. A used call
value depends on the callee result. Returns connect to the enclosing result.
Tail calls connect caller and callee result liveness in both directions. Local
flow distinguishes entry parameters from overwritten locals; branch payloads
and the result types of their targets remain valid.

Each HOT body is released after analysis and relifted only for mutation. LocalGraph
uses symbolic block-entry sources and sparse changed-local summaries when a
linear reverse scan cannot represent nested control. It resolves complete
predecessor closures before caching, preserving loops and exception paths.
The new solver matches the converged forward reference on 5,000 GenValid modules.

After solving, the pass builds new signatures, preserves argument evaluation
order with typed temporary locals when necessary, removes unused pure values,
and keeps their effectful or trapping descendants. It rewrites functions,
call sites, returns and eligible type families as one candidate module, verifies
HOT and validates the completed module. The dispatcher rebuilds module analyses.

Referenced type families retain subtype/recursion metadata. Open-world type
exposure pins signatures; a private unreferenced sibling can receive a distinct
signature even when its former type also describes a continuation or export.
The intrinsic `binaryen-intrinsics` / `call.without.effects` pins its target's
signature. Ordinary DAE remains available for independent comparison.

Legacy catch payloads are captured at handler entry before call-argument wrappers
can change their stack position. Multiple handlers are represented through
`try_table` with explicit handler labels. Ordinary catches retain only payloads;
functions with a rethrow use `catch_ref` and capture exception identity, including
rethrows that target an outer handler. A handler executes outside its protected body, so a throw
inside one handler is not accidentally caught by its sibling.

This is implementation evidence, not a claim that every upstream output shape
or every proposal already matches. The [validation page](starshine-port-readiness-and-validation.md)
and [upgrade ledger](../../version-132-upgrade.md) track the remaining signoff.
