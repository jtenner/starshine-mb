# Starshine DAE2 implementation

This page describes the implemented Binaryen 132 port, superseding the earlier
proposal to leave `dae2` unknown or to add only parameter forwarding.

The module pass owns a short-lived usage graph. Each function parameter and
whole result tuple has a location; HOT expression values have locations too.
Type-family locations connect referenced functions to indirect calls. Observable
uses seed the graph, and a queue visits each live location at most once.

## September 25, 2026 nearest-write indexing

The shared reverse-flow LocalGraph builder now records each get's nearest within-block write during its existing action walk. It resets only written local slots at block boundaries and retains the same predecessor/exception closure when no within-block write exists. This removes repeated backward prefix scans without changing reaching-definition facts. The [dedicated native benchmark](../../../../../src/passes_perf_long/dae2_local_graph_perf_test.mbt) improved from `4.15ms` to `403.57µs` at 1,024 distant reads and from `14.95ms` to `795.21µs` at 2,048; [bounded tests](../../../../../src/ir/local_graph_reverse_wbtest.mbt) cover overwrites and sibling-block isolation. All 407 IR tests and 70 DAE2 tests pass on wasm-gc. `moon info` and formatting pass with no public API change from this unit.

On the 189 KB fixture, DAE2 pass-local median improved from `25.862ms` to `23.189ms` (10.3%), with identical raw output SHA-256 `f8b4d5e5c7b6372ad8d6a2193df5f2db61ec4ce2462b40095a762dfe226a35f7`. Verified Binaryen 133 measured `1.347ms` in the new sweep, so the pass still loses by `17.21x`. [Binaryen 133 DAE2](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/blob/version_133/src/passes/DeadArgumentElimination2.cpp) queries `LazyLocalGraph` only for parameter gets; Starshine still eagerly builds broader local liveness to support its expression-removal graph. That larger analysis difference remains an optimization target. Artifacts are `.tmp/dae2-localgraph-bench-{before,after}.log` and `.tmp/pass-sweep-v133-{dae2-localgraph-before,localgraph-after-small}-20260925/`.

The fresh open-world `dae2` aggregate compares 10,000 cases against verified v133 with the explicit native binary and eight subprocesses: 2,879 normalized matches, 667 cleanup-normalized matches, and 6,454 residual output differences. Node-v2 observes equal original/Starshine/Binaryen results in 9,312 cases; all 688 continuation cases remain blocked by the original runtime. There are no semantic mismatches or validation/property/generator/command failures. All residuals are canonically smaller, but size alone does not close parity: reviewed unused-local removal is an exact cleanup benefit; the remaining families remain parity gaps or runtime-blocked uncertainty. Evidence: `.tmp/pass-fuzz-dae2-localgraph-open-v133-10000/result.json` and its persisted diffs/runtime observations.

The closed-world companion also completes 10,000 cases: 100 cleanup-normalized matches and 9,900 residual differences, with the same 9,312 runtime matches, 688 runtime-blocked continuations, and zero semantic/validation/property/generator/command failures. Its 706 canonically larger indirect-call cases remain size-losing parity gaps: Starshine retains the indirect type family's parameter and dropped result where Binaryen removes them (saved case 5 is 83 versus 82 canonical bytes). The other residual families remain open unless individually justified. Both lanes use native SHA-256 `72b55be2e092167030dccf79d6e48f646d338c16791852a9a9171d73b41b9894`; closed-world evidence is `.tmp/pass-fuzz-dae2-localgraph-closed-v133-10000/result.json`. These results validate the indexing change without claiming complete DAE2 parity.

## September 24, 2026 repeated-solve measurement

Type-identity conflict handling can observe more graph locations and call `solve` again. The graph now retains its queue cursor between solves, so earlier locations are not scanned again; edges must be complete before the first solve. The native release white-box benchmark in [`dae2_repeated_solve_perf_wbtest.mbt`](../../../../../src/passes/dae2_repeated_solve_perf_wbtest.mbt) measured 128 incremental observations/solves at `10.11 → 2.29 µs` (4.41×) and 256 at `34.80 → 4.43 µs` (7.86×). A second-solve propagation test and 64 existing DAE2 tests pass. This isolates graph behavior; pass-level impact on real identity conflicts remains unmeasured.

Direct call arguments depend on the corresponding callee parameter. A used call
value depends on the callee result. Returns connect to the enclosing result.
Tail calls connect caller and callee result liveness in both directions. Local
flow distinguishes entry parameters from overwritten locals; branch payloads
and the result types of their targets remain valid.

Each HOT body is released after analysis and relifted only for mutation. LocalGraph
uses symbolic block-entry sources and sparse changed-local summaries when a
linear reverse scan cannot represent nested control. It resolves complete
predecessor closures before caching, preserving loops and exception paths.
The new solver matches the converged forward reference on 5,000 GenValid modules.

After solving, the pass builds new signatures, preserves argument evaluation
order with typed temporary locals when necessary, removes unused pure values,
and keeps their effectful or trapping descendants. It rewrites functions,
call sites, returns and eligible type families as one candidate module, verifies
HOT and validates the completed module. The dispatcher rebuilds module analyses.

Referenced type families retain subtype/recursion metadata. Open-world type
exposure pins signatures; a private unreferenced sibling can receive a distinct
signature even when its former type also describes a continuation or export.
The intrinsic `binaryen-intrinsics` / `call.without.effects` pins its target's
signature. Ordinary DAE remains available for independent comparison.

Legacy catch payloads are captured at handler entry before call-argument wrappers
can change their stack position. Multiple handlers are represented through
`try_table` with explicit handler labels. Ordinary catches retain only payloads;
functions with a rethrow use `catch_ref` and capture exception identity, including
rethrows that target an outer handler. A handler executes outside its protected body, so a throw
inside one handler is not accidentally caught by its sibling.

This is implementation evidence, not a claim that every upstream output shape
or every proposal already matches. The [validation page](starshine-port-readiness-and-validation.md)
and [upgrade ledger](../../version-132-upgrade.md) track the remaining signoff.
