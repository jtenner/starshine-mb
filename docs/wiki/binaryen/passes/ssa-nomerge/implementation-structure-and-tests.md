# `ssa-nomerge` implementation structure and tests

## Why this page exists

`ssa-nomerge` already had a strong algorithm page and a Starshine strategy page, but it was missing the standard owner-file / proof-surface map used by many neighboring pass dossiers.

Use this page when you need to answer:

- which Binaryen files implement the upstream pass;
- which upstream tests prove no-merge behavior instead of full `--ssa` behavior;
- which local MoonBit files implement Starshine's current strategy;
- which local tests prove the active Starshine pass and which tests are only parity/signoff evidence.

## Upstream owner-file map

| Binaryen file | What it proves |
| --- | --- |
| `src/passes/SSAify.cpp` | Single implementation owner for both `ssa` and `ssa-nomerge`; the `allowMerges` flag selects full merge materialization versus no-merge behavior. It also owns fresh-local allocation, get/default rewrites, full-SSA phi helpers, prepends, and the narrow `ReFinalize` trigger. |
| `src/ir/local-graph.h` | Public helper contract used by `SSAify`: `getSets`, `getSetInfluences`, `computeSetInfluences`, `computeSSAIndexes`, and the `nullptr` entry/default-source convention. |
| `src/ir/LocalGraph.cpp` | The control-flow flower that computes reaching local sets and influenced gets across structured control. This is why upstream `ssa-nomerge` is whole-function flow reasoning, not a syntactic set/get peephole. |
| `src/ir/ReFinalize.cpp` | Type-repair dependency used after default reference replacement can sharpen expression types. It is not a second rewrite engine. |
| `src/passes/pass.cpp` | Public pass registration plus default-function-pipeline scheduling. It registers both `ssa` and `ssa-nomerge` and places `ssa-nomerge` early in optimize/shrink function optimization. |
| `src/passes/passes.h` | Factory declarations for `createSSAifyPass()` and `createSSAifyNoMergePass()`. |

Primary URLs are captured in [`../../../raw/binaryen/2026-05-01-ssa-nomerge-implementation-primary-sources.md`](../../../raw/binaryen/2026-05-01-ssa-nomerge-implementation-primary-sources.md).

## Upstream algorithm ownership in one pass through the file

`SSAify.cpp` runs each function in this order:

1. build `LocalGraph`;
2. compute set influences;
3. compute already-SSA indexes;
4. create fresh indexes for eligible sets;
5. compute get rewrites and, only for full `ssa`, phi-like merge rewrites;
6. add any function-entry prepends;
7. run `ReFinalize` only if default reference replacement requires type repair.

For `ssa-nomerge`, the decisive rule is still per-set: if any get influenced by a set has multiple reaching sets, that set is left on the canonical local slot. Full merge-local creation lives next to the no-merge code, but it is selected only by the full `ssa` pass.

## Upstream test map

| Test surface | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| `test/passes/ssa-nomerge_enable-simd.wast` | Dedicated no-merge input fixture. It is the strongest compact upstream example set for straight-line untangling, default materialization, SIMD defaults, and merge bailouts. |
| `test/passes/ssa-nomerge_enable-simd.txt` | Golden output for the dedicated no-merge fixture. Use it to distinguish no-merge canonical-slot behavior from full `ssa` merge-local behavior. |
| `test/lit/passes/ssa.wast` | Shared full-SSA helper surface. It is useful for understanding default/ref/tuple helper behavior, but do not treat full-`ssa` merge materialization there as `ssa-nomerge` behavior. |
| `test/gtest/local-graph.cpp` | Helper-level proof surface for LocalGraph flow assumptions: reaching sets, obstacles, structured control, unreachable-code looseness, and multi-set cases. |

## Starshine implementation map

Starshine implements an active pass with the same public goal, but the owner split is very different from Binaryen.

| Local file | Current role |
| --- | --- |
| `src/passes/ssa_nomerge.mbt:2` | `ssa_nomerge_descriptor()` declares the active HOT pass name, required analyses, and invalidation contract. |
| `src/passes/ssa_nomerge.mbt:15` | Summary/help text; currently says the pass untangles locals and lowers overlay phis through predecessor copies. |
| `src/passes/ssa_nomerge.mbt:20` | Cheap local-write gate. |
| `src/passes/ssa_nomerge.mbt:34` | Rewrite-needed check over overlay phis and concrete local write defs. |
| `src/passes/ssa_nomerge.mbt:49` | Main HOT pass wrapper; requires CFG and local SSA, then delegates to `@ir.ssa_destroy_into_hot(...)`. |
| `src/ir/ssa_destroy.mbt:33` | `HotSsaDestroyPolicy`; current policy surface exposes `ReusePhiLocals`. |
| `src/ir/ssa_destroy.mbt:157` | Builds explicit predecessor-copy HOT nodes. |
| `src/ir/ssa_destroy.mbt:455` | Inserts predecessor copies at predecessor-block boundaries. |
| `src/ir/ssa_destroy.mbt:527` | `ssa_destroy_into_hot(...)`, the real lifted HOT SSA-destruction bridge used by the pass. |
| `src/passes/pass_manager.mbt:5768` | Raw default/local-read materialization helper. |
| `src/passes/pass_manager.mbt:5915` | Raw initialized-local seed logic. |
| `src/passes/pass_manager.mbt:6788` | Structured raw `ssa-nomerge` rewrite path. |
| `src/passes/pass_manager.mbt:6826` | Straight-line raw alias rewrite path. |
| `src/passes/pass_manager.mbt:6937` | Raw dispatcher choosing skip, structured, and straight-line paths. |
| `src/passes/pass_manager.mbt:7865` | Raw pass-manager hook for the `ssa-nomerge` special case. |
| `src/passes/pass_manager.mbt:8727` | Lifted HOT dispatch case for `ssa-nomerge`. |
| `src/passes/optimize.mbt:157` | Registry entry for the active pass name. |
| `src/passes/optimize.mbt:267` and `src/passes/optimize.mbt:279` | Preset queue placement in optimize and shrink. |
| `src/passes/optimize.mbt:405` and `src/passes/optimize.mbt:420` | Public preset-pass arrays. |

The important local-vs-upstream lesson is the same as in [`./starshine-hot-ir-strategy.md`](./starshine-hot-ir-strategy.md): Starshine can lower overlay phis through explicit predecessor copies, while Binaryen `ssa-nomerge` deliberately avoids merge materialization.

## Starshine test map

| Local test surface | What it proves |
| --- | --- |
| `src/passes/ssa_nomerge_test.mbt:48` | Straight-line local traffic can stay canonical. |
| `src/passes/ssa_nomerge_test.mbt:68` | Latest straight-line alias stays live. |
| `src/passes/ssa_nomerge_test.mbt:99` and `:119` | Dead param set/tee rewrites spill through fresh locals. |
| `src/passes/ssa_nomerge_test.mbt:140` | Structured param writes can remain canonical. |
| `src/passes/ssa_nomerge_test.mbt:189` | Branch joins lower through explicit predecessor copies. |
| `src/passes/ssa_nomerge_test.mbt:243` | Loop-carried locals lower before the backedge. |
| `src/passes/ssa_nomerge_test.mbt:304` | Root loop headers avoid synthetic entry copies. |
| `src/passes/ssa_nomerge_test.mbt:358`, `:405`, and `:469` | Raw structured early-return and block-target branch families preserve canonical locals. |
| `src/passes/ssa_nomerge_test.mbt:526` and `:596` | Result-typed `if` merge families remain valid in the raw path. |
| `src/passes/ssa_nomerge_test.mbt:642` and `:685` | Reduced `Func 523` / unreachable carrier followups remain covered. |
| `src/cmd/cmd_wbtest.mbt:1915` | CLI adapter applies `--ssa-nomerge` to wasm inputs. |
| `src/cmd/cmd_wbtest.mbt:2394` | Debug-artifact replay validates under `--ssa-nomerge`. |
| `src/cmd/cmd_wbtest.mbt:2434` | Extracted `Func 523` replay avoids the older writeback type-mismatch skip. |

## Validation guidance

For upstream comparison work:

- use `wasm-opt --ssa-nomerge --enable-simd -S` on reduced local-traffic fixtures;
- compare against the dedicated no-merge golden output before consulting full `--ssa` fixtures;
- keep merge-local or incoming-`tee` output classified as full `ssa`, not `ssa-nomerge`.

For Starshine signoff:

- run focused `src/passes/ssa_nomerge_test.mbt` tests when changing local rewrite logic;
- keep CLI debug-artifact replay in the loop because local writeback/validation guards are part of the actual pass boundary;
- use [`./parity.md`](./parity.md) for the current fuzz/debug-artifact evidence level;
- do not claim exact raw-byte parity unless a fresh artifact skip census and canonical wasm comparison support it.

## Caveats

- This page is an implementation map, not a new behavior contract.
- The upstream source contract remains the `version_129` oracle plus narrow current-main checks recorded in the raw manifests.
- Local line numbers are current as of 2026-05-01 and should be refreshed if future code motion touches the cited files.
